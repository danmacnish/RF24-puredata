/*
RF24Listener
This external for puredata is written using the flext environment.
The code reads data from an NRF24L01+ module connected to a raspberry pi and outputs it to pureData.

Dependencies: RF24 library. If you compile this code from source, you will also need to install the flext environment.

required hardware:

Reciever:
NRF24L01+ connected to a raspberry pi

transmitter:
NRF24L01+ connected to an arduino pro mini

Autoacknowledgement is not used. pipeline 1 is enabled.
